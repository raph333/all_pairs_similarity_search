This repository contains simiple python implementations of different versions of all-pairs similarity search algorithm presented by Bayardo et. al.

Roberto J. Bayardo, Yiming Ma, and Ramakrishnan Srikant. 2007. Scaling up all pairs similarity search. In Proceedings of the 16th international conference on World Wide Web (WWW '07). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 131-140. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1145/1242572.1242591

The aim of implementing the algorithms is be able to follow the algorithms step by step with simple examples.
